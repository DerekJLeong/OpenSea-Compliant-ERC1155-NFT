OpenSea compliant ERC1155 contract to create NFT collections. This really shouldnt be used with anything except OpenSea but I suppose you could. WHY? Well... OpenSea names their collections based off a 'name' public string variable, soooo one name per contract, with ERC1155 we should be able to mint and use a single contract to support MULTIPLE collections by using a 'name' property in the token's metadata. You can use this to make collections with less fees vs ERC721 equivalent.
