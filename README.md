# OpenSea compliant ERC1155 contract to create NFT collections.

This really shouldnt be used with anything except OpenSea but I suppose you could.

WHY? Well... OpenSea names their collections based off a 'name' public string variable, soooo one name per contract,
with ERC1155 we should be able to mint and use a single contract to support MULTIPLE collections by using a 'name'
property in the token's metadata.

You can use this to make collections with less fees vs an ERC721 equivalent.

 On the topic of metadata, make sure your collection's is OpenSea compliant. This repo wont help you with.
This link will though:
https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards

Ill probably update this README with more info on how you can use this. You can also pay me to show you! ;)

Goodluck and happy coding.
